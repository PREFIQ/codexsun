# Changelog

## Version State

Current version: 1.0.11

Release tag: v-1.0.11

Changelog label: v 1.0.11

This changelog starts fresh from the cleaned CODEXSUN foundation. Earlier copied application history was intentionally removed because it did not represent the current workspace.

New entries should keep database-facing work and application code work separate.

#### Database Changes

Records schema, migration, seed, tenant provisioning, and data compatibility changes.

#### App Codebase Changes

Records UI, API, service logic, tooling, packaging, and documentation changes.

## v-1.0.11

### [v 1.0.11] 2026-07-10 2:23 pm - Quotation item table polish

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (manual).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.11.

## v-1.0.10

### [v 1.0.10] 2026-07-10 12:00 pm - Core Work Order Module Ownership

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Added the protected Work Order placeholder seed (`WO-0000`) for `core_master_work_orders`.
- Aligned master-record protection so global and placeholder records are blocked consistently in update, status, and force-delete flows.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Moved Work Order out of the shared master workspace/list wrappers into module-owned `work-order` workspace, list, form, hooks, services, and definition files.
- Flattened the Work Order form into one owned panel and removed inherited Contact/Product tabs.
- Removed Contact lookup and Contact list column from Work Order so the module no longer feels coupled to Contact master behavior.
- Kept Work Order name and code as edit links for editable rows while protected rows render plain text with the protected indicator.
- Removed Work Order-specific branches from the shared master workspace so future Contact/Product changes do not bleed into Work Order.
- Verified the refactor with Core Web and Platform Web type checks.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.10.

## v-1.0.9

### [v 1.0.9] 2026-07-09 7:53 pm - Billing Settings and Quotation Workflow

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Preserved operator-configured tenant app access during default-tenant boot seeding instead of replacing it with seed defaults.
- Synchronized tenant module settings so disabled and enabled app records remain accurate after provisioning and restart.
- Extended tenant billing settings JSON with shared layout, printing, customisation, feature, and document-numbering defaults.
- Added backward-compatible normalization for legacy per-document layouts and removed obsolete hidden feature and totals settings.
- Added tenant-scoped automatic numbering profiles for Sales, Quotation, Purchase, and Export Sales.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Added development-only CODEXSUN tenant auto-login controlled by `.env`, using the normal server-side credential verification and session flow.
- Added Billing API to the Platform development stack and verified Billing Settings startup, CORS, and tenant database loading.
- Rebuilt Billing Settings with shared global PO, DC, Colour, Size, E-invoice, and E-way controls for Quotation, Sales, and Purchase.
- Added persisted Printing controls, custom terms, live letterhead preview/designer, document titles, print language, and focused feature switches for Quotation, Export Sales, and TConnect.
- Added a Document Settings workspace with automatic mode, prefix, separator, suffix, next number, padding, and live previews.
- Connected automatic numbering to Sales and Quotation creation and advanced counters only after successful saves.
- Reshaped Quotation entry with header tabs, Details, Other Details, Address, and Terms sections; removed Quotation E-way and E-invoice tabs.
- Reordered Quotation details into customer/work-order and number/date/tax columns, moved item entry into Details, aligned totals right, and added Save, Save & Print, and Cancel footer actions.
- Connected Quotation PO, DC, Colour, and Size item columns to the global Billing Layout switches.
- Added regression coverage for tenant access preservation and updated Billing Settings validation for the finalized payload.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.9.

## v-1.0.8

### [v 1.0.8] 2026-07-09 5:17 pm - update sales quotations

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (auto-check).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.8.

## v-1.0.7

### [v 1.0.7] 2026-07-08 7:28 pm - Database Lifecycle CLI

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Added Platform database lifecycle commands for master and tenant databases: `db:migrate`, `db:seed`, `db:drop`, and `dbmigrate:fresh`.
- Added a Platform API database CLI that reuses the same Kysely migration and seed paths as application startup.
- Added tenant app-module migration and seed passes so registered tenant databases are migrated and seeded from the master tenant registry.
- Added `CODEXSUN_DB_FRESH_ON_START` to optionally drop, recreate, migrate, and seed configured databases during API startup.
- Added destructive action guards: `CODEXSUN_DB_RESET_CONFIRM=DROP_DATABASES`, plus `CODEXSUN_ALLOW_PRODUCTION_DB_RESET=1` when `NODE_ENV=production`.
- Made drop/fresh remove registered tenant databases before dropping the master database.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Simplified the tenant Countries list and editor to show only country name, country code, status, and active control;
  ISO, dial, currency, and sort-order fields remain backend-compatible but are hidden from the tenant frontend.
- Added tenant Country row actions for view, edit, suspend, and guarded force delete, with global country protection.
- Restyled the location Active control as a compact input-height status switch without helper text.
- Fixed bodyless location action requests so Suspend and Force delete are not rejected as empty JSON payloads.
- Replaced generic location duplicate failures with exact name/code conflict messages in the form error banner.
- Simplified the tenant State editor to State name, GST State code, Country, and Active in the same full-width tone as Country.
- Added State view, edit, suspend, and guarded force-delete row actions.
- Added reusable location dependency checks that block force deletion while child location records still reference a parent.
- Applied the finalized full-width master form and row-action pattern to Districts, Cities, and Pincodes.
- Replaced Pincode parent-name inputs with cascading Country, State, District, and City references.
- Enabled editing, suspension, and guarded deletion of seeded District, City, and Pincode rows inside each isolated tenant database.
- Made primary District, City, and Pincode values open Edit directly, removed redundant View actions, and protected the `-` placeholder rows.
- Backfilled seeded Pincodes with Country, State, District, and City IDs so legacy records populate relationship controls and participate in dependency checks.
- Added Tenant-pattern pagination to every location master list with rows-per-page controls, filtered totals, stable row numbering, and page reset on filter changes.
- Applied the finalized master-list pattern to Contact Groups, Contact Types, Address Types, and Bank Names.
- Added protected `-` seeds, editable seeded rows, pagination, clickable names, lifecycle menus, compact Active controls, and force delete for those four masters.
- Seeded Contact Groups with Business and Web Clients, and Contact Types with Customer, Supplier, Vendor Customer, Staff, and Employee.
- Expanded Bank Names from the current RBI directory across public, private, local-area, small-finance, payments, regional-rural, foreign, and state cooperative banks.
- Replaced protected-row text with a shared amber shield indicator and hover tooltip across location and contact masters.
- Extended the finalized protected-row, editable seed, pagination, lifecycle menu, compact Active, and no-sort-order pattern to all Product, Work Order, and Other common masters.
- Added persisted Currency symbols with INR and USD seed backfill, plus reusable missing-column migration support for common masters.
- Converted Months into FY 2026-27 accounting periods with Name, From date, To date, and Active.
- Added loud CLI/startup warnings before destructive database lifecycle actions.
- Added stable migration preflight/list/run/local-test, dump, restore-test, and backup-verification command names.
- Added explicit safety guards for restored-dump migration tests, sandbox restore tests, production backup verification, and backup artifact verification.
- Added database migration, backup, and legacy client migration runbooks plus reusable legacy intake/mapping/validation/cutover templates.
- Documented the baseline backup and restore-test schedule.
- Added console progress logs for database bootstrap, master/tenant database creation, migrations, platform app seeding,
  default tenant seeding, tenant module seeding, tenant admin seed status, and database CLI commands.
- Standardized Platform dev logs so `platform-api` displays as `api` and `platform-web` displays as `web` in stack and
  preflight output.
- Closed tenant database pools after provisioning so one-shot DB commands exit cleanly.
- Documented lifecycle switches in `.env` and `.env.example`.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.7.

## v-1.0.6

### [v 1.0.6] 2026-07-08 7:20 pm - Env Driven Tenant Domain Seed

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Added `DEFAULT_TENANT_DOMAIN` so the test-only default tenant seed stores its primary domain from env.
- Added `TENANT_DOMAIN_BASE` so newly created tenant domains are generated from env instead of a hard-coded `.codexsun.local` suffix.
- Set the local/test default domain values to `localhost` in `.env` and `.env.example` while keeping seed data disabled and blank by default.
- Updated the CODEXSUN auth e2e to verify login through the seeded `localhost` tenant domain.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Removed the remaining hard-coded default tenant domain suffix from Platform API tenant seed/repository paths.
- Added `assist/documentation/project-inventory.md` as the current workspace inventory and latest work update for future agents.
- Linked the project inventory from `assist/README.md` and added it to the recommended reading order.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.6.

## v-1.0.5

### [v 1.0.5] 2026-07-08 7:04 pm - Test-Only Default Tenant Seed

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Moved the default tenant seed behind `ENABLE_DEFAULT_TENANT_SEED=1`.
- Cleared fixed master database, tenant database, DB user, DB password, JWT, and seed user values from `.env` and `.env.example`.
- Made `DEFAULT_TENANT_*` optional for normal runtime and required only when the test seed switch is enabled.
- Kept CODEXSUN seed data inside e2e setup only, with disposable test databases.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Updated the environment helper banner to explain that default tenant values are test-only.
- Updated tenant database e2e setup to explicitly enable and configure the default seed for test runs.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.5.

## v-1.0.4

### [v 1.0.4] 2026-07-08 6:59 pm - Strict Environment Configuration

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Removed runtime fallback database names from Platform, Core, Billing, and database helper code.
- Required `DB_MASTER_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `DEFAULT_TENANT_*` values to come from explicit environment configuration.
- Changed the database user helper to read root `.env` and require configured admin/app user credentials and tenant database values.
- Kept e2e database tests isolated by injecting their own disposable environment values.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Added a shared missing/invalid `.env` banner with setup commands: `Copy-Item .env.example .env` and `npm run env:jwt-secret`.
- Removed runtime JWT development-secret fallbacks from Core and Billing APIs.
- Removed hard-coded admin email placeholders from shared UI layouts.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.4.

## v-1.0.3

### [v 1.0.3] 2026-07-08 6:52 pm - CODEXSUN Database Naming Seed

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Changed the default master database name from `codexsun_master_db` to `cxsun_master_db`.
- Changed the default `CODEXSUN` tenant database name from `codexsun_tenant_db` to `codexsun_db`.
- Updated Platform, Core, Billing, setup tooling, and assist architecture references to use the new master database default.
- Kept the default tenant seeder idempotent so first boot creates or updates the `CODEXSUN` tenant with the new tenant database name.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Updated the `CODEXSUN` tenant auth e2e to run against disposable databases using the new naming pattern and verify seed, login, JWT/session, and tenant runtime.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.3.

## v-1.0.2

### [v 1.0.2] 2026-07-08 6:35 pm - Default CODEXSUN Tenant Auth Seed

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Added an idempotent default tenant seed for `CODEXSUN` during Platform API bootstrap.
- Added `.env`-driven default tenant settings: name, corporate ID, slug, tenant database name, and default tenant admin credentials.
- Provisioned the default `CODEXSUN` tenant database with tenant module settings and a tenant-local admin user when `DEFAULT_TENANT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is configured.
- Kept tenant identity database-owned by seeding master tenant and tenant domain rows, with `uuid` used for external JWT/session identity.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Hardened tenant login around the seeded tenant path: Corporate ID + domain resolution, tenant database lookup, tenant-local user verification, signed JWT issue, session verification, and tenant runtime access.
- Added `CODEXSUN` start-to-finish e2e coverage that boots the app, seeds the tenant, logs in, verifies the signed JWT/session, resolves runtime, and cleans up disposable databases.
- Updated platform e2e script to include both tenant database isolation and default tenant auth flows.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.2.

## v-1.0.1

### [v 1.0.1] 2026-07-08 2:12 pm - Clean Platform Foundation

#### Database Changes

- Removed copied demo tenant seed data from the Platform API in-memory tenant repository.
- Kept the tenant registry empty by default so the platform starts without fake customer data.
- Kept tenant module persistence as an in-memory foundation only; no production database migration was added in this baseline.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Reduced the copied workspace to the current runnable foundation: `apps/platform/api`, `apps/platform/web`, `packages/framework`, `packages/ui`, and tooling.
- Removed stale Core, Billing, Accounts, Ecommerce, CRM, Sites, and copied Platform package wiring from workspace references, dependency manifests, TypeScript config, Vite aliases, package lock state, preflight, and dist collection.
- Reorganized Platform Web into a clean source structure:
  - `src/app` for bootstrap, providers, router, and design-system setup.
  - `src/desks` for `/sa`, `/admin`, and `/app` desk shells.
  - `src/modules/tenant` for the tenant frontend module.
  - `src/routes/public` for home, login, and status routes.
  - `src/shared` for API client, auth gate, and document title helpers.
- Removed the old `src/pages` dumping area, copied super-admin pages, template pages, design-system demo page, and stale tenant pages.
- Added the first standard Platform API module under `apps/platform/api/src/modules/tenant` using the required module file pattern:
  - `tenant.module.ts`
  - `tenant.service.ts`
  - `tenant.repository.ts`
  - `tenant.routes.ts`
  - `tenant.events.ts`
  - `tenant.migration.ts`
  - `tenant.worker.ts`
  - `tenant.seed.ts`
  - `tenant.sync.ts`
  - `tenant.test.ts`
  - `tenant.types.ts`
  - `index.ts`
- Updated the module-boundary checker to validate the current one-folder, module-prefixed file standard instead of the older folder-heavy pattern.
- Replaced the Platform Web API client with a local envelope-aware fetch client.
- Simplified Platform API auth/session routes into a development foundation without fake tenant records.
- Cleaned `/`, `/sa`, `/admin`, `/app`, and `/status` so they no longer show demo tenant names, fake databases, fake users, scaffold labels, or copied product claims.
- Removed unimplemented future module choices from tenant setup; tenant access now only guarantees `platform.tenant`.
- Removed copied API JSON registries, old e2e references, invalid database scripts, and stale Playwright config.
- Removed unused demo dashboard blocks and fake menu defaults from `packages/ui`.
- Pruned copied public/design/print CSS from Platform Web and kept only styles used by the current routes.
- Set Vite cache under the root dependency tree and kept a single root `node_modules`.
- Kept build output collected under the root `dist/` packaging surface.
- Verified the cleaned foundation with:
  - `npm.cmd run check`
  - `npm.cmd run build`
  - route smoke checks for `/`, `/sa`, `/admin`, `/app`, and `/status`.
